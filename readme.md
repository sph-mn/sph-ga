# sph-ga
this is a javascript library for fundamental calculations of euclidean and conformal geometric algebras. custom algebras are possible.

the focus of this implementation is on compactness and flexibility (functional, with basic data structures to allow easy abstraction) as well as compactness and generality (straightforward and no limitations).

the collection of automated test might also be useful for testing other geometric algebra libraries.

## status
*work in progress*: still in development.

# license
lgpl3+

# usage
compiled/ga.js contains the javascript version.
use with node.js via `require("./ga.js")` or include the code in html using `<script type="text/javascript" src="ga.js"></script>`.

# usage
the examples are using the [coffeescript](https://coffeescript.org/) javascript syntax.

## creating a space
~~~
r3 = new sph_ga [1, 1, 1]
~~~

this example supplies an euclidean (diagonal) metric. for more options, see the section "customization" below.

## creating vectors
all types are represented as multivector objects.

`s(number)` creates a scalar.
~~~
s1 = r3.s 1
~~~

`basis(n, coefficient=1)` creates the basis vector with that index. index 0 is the scalar.
~~~
e3 = r3.basis 3
~~~

`vector([coefficient, ...])` creates a multivector for as many bases in order as specified. the first array element is the scalar.
~~~
a = r3.vector [0, 2, 3, 4]   # a = 0 + 2e1 + 3e2 + 4e3
~~~

`mv([[[basis_index ...], coefficient], ...])` creates custom multivectors where multiple exterior-product-combined basis indices can be specified for each blade. blades can be specified arbitrarily in any order.
~~~
a = r3.mv [
  [[0], 1]  # scalar part: 1
  [[2], 3]  # 3 * e2
  [[2, 3], 4]  # 4 * e23
]
~~~

## operations
~~~
e1 = r3.basis 1
e2 = r3.basis 2
e3 = r3.basis 3

geometric_product = r3.gp e1, e2
exterior_product = r3.ep e1, e2
~~~

~~~
# 1 + 2 * e1 + 3 * e23
a = r3.mv [
  [[0], 1]
  [[1], 2]
  [[2, 3], 3]
]

# 4 * e2 + 5 * e123
b = r3.mv [
  [[2], 4]
  [[1, 2, 3], 5]
]

inner_product = r3.ip a, b
~~~

see section "api" for all available functions.

## accessing components
blades are accesible by `id` in a vector object.

`get(multivector, id)` extracts a blade with a specific id or returns `null` if it is not included.

~~~
a = r3.s -4
scalar_coefficient = blade_coeff get a, 0  # -4
~~~

## working with the pseudoscalar
~~~
ps = r3.pseudoscalar()
ps_grade = r3.grade ps  # should be 3 for r3
ps_squared = r3.gp ps, ps  # should be -1 for r3
~~~

## accessing space properties
~~~
r3.n  # dimensions
~~~

## data types
sph_ga uses three compound types: space (object), multivector (array[][3]), and blade (array[3]).

# api
in this library, round bracket enclosed lists are javascript arrays. note that the functions do not validate input arguments and expect strict adherence to the [contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract). the listing uses this [type signature format](https://sph.mn/computer/designs/type-signature.html).

# customization

## metric tensor
the metric array passed in the options defines the signature of the space. each element represents the square of a basis vector combination:
* `1` for spacelike dimensions
* `-1` for timelike dimensions
* `0` for null dimensions

other values, eg for non-orthogonal metrics, are possible.
diagonal metrics can be configured using flat arrays. for example, [1, 1, 1].
custom tensors can be provided as an "n * n" array. example for five dimensions:
~~~
metric = [
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, -1],
  [0, 0, 0, -1, 0],
]

space = new sph_ga metric

# ideas
* the library could easily be ported to c
* more performance optimizations. possibly decompose computations into lower-dimensional subspaces
